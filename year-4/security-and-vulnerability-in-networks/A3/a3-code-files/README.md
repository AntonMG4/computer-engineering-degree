## README main.py
This script demonstrates a simplified blockchain system, showcasing essential blockchain functions 
like wallet creation, transaction handling, block mining, and chain validation.

The script initializes a blockchain with configurable transaction limits and difficulty. Ten user 
wallets, each with a unique cryptographic key pair, generate and sign transactions. Valid transactions 
are added to the blockchain's pool until it reaches capacity, at which point a new block is mined. 
Each block is securely linked to the previous one, forming an immutable chain.

The script also verifies transaction inclusion and simulates tampering by modifying a transaction in 
an existing block, which should render the chain invalid and highlight blockchain’s resistance to 
tampering.

## README main_async.py
This script demonstrates an asynchronous blockchain system, where transactions are generated and mined 
concurrently using threads. The goal is to simulate a real-time blockchain environment with independent 
transaction processing and mining.

The script initializes a blockchain with configurable transaction limits (max_tx_per_block) and difficulty 
settings, along with a queue for asynchronous transaction management. Ten user wallets are created, each 
capable of generating signed transactions. These transactions are placed in a queue, where they are 
continuously added until the queue reaches the block capacity. Meanwhile, a separate mining thread collects 
transactions from the queue and attempts to mine a new block, validating and linking it to the blockchain.

## README main_tests.py
This script runs performance tests on the blockchain system, measuring transaction processing and mining 
speeds under different conditions. It provides insight into the blockchain’s throughput and efficiency at 
varying transaction limits and difficulty levels.

The script begins by initializing a blockchain with adjustable transaction limits and difficulty. It then 
performs two main tests:

- Transaction Rate Test: This test measures the transaction throughput by adjusting the maximum transactions 
per block and tracking the rate of processing over a fixed duration. This gives insight into how changes in 
block capacity affect the transaction rate.

- Mining Speed Test: The script tests mining speed by adjusting the difficulty level and measuring the time 
taken to mine blocks. The results are plotted to visualize how increasing difficulty affects mining time, 
illustrating the trade-off between security and speed in the blockchain.
